                <td>The Sword in the Stone</td>
                <td>Arthur, a young boy, was raised as a squire unaware of his royal lineage. After the death of King Uther, England fell into chaos with no clear heir. Merlin, the wise wizard, set a mystical sword in a stone, inscribed with the message that whoever could pull the sword would be the rightful king. Many tried and failed, but during a tournament, Arthur, needing a sword for his brother, effortlessly pulled the sword from the stone, revealing his destiny as the future King of England.</td>

                <td>The Formation of the Knights of the Round Table</td>
                <td>Once crowned king, Arthur sought to bring peace and unity to his kingdom. He established the Knights of the Round Table, a fellowship of noble warriors dedicated to justice, chivalry, and protecting the realm. Unlike other tables, the Round Table symbolized equality, with no head or foot, representing that all knights were equal in their quest for honor and service. Famous knights like Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, and Sir Galahad became part of this legendary order.</td>

                <td>The Quest for the Holy Grail</td>
                <td>The Knights of the Round Table set out on the divine quest to find the Holy Grail, the cup Jesus drank from at the Last Supper. Many knights, including Lancelot, failed to find it due to their personal flaws. Only the pure-hearted Sir Galahad, along with Sir Bors and Sir Perceval, succeeded. Galahad, after seeing divine visions, fulfilled the quest by taking the Grail to the city of Sarras, where it ascended to Heaven, ending the quest but leaving Camelot spiritually diminished.</td>
